# Personal Website - Updated Version
Current Domain: https://calvinjmin.com

As a current student at the University of Virginia, this project will be used to display my personal portfolio 
as an aspiring software engineer. This entire website was made from scratch using a custom domain purchased through Route 53 (AWS). 
This personal website will be an updated version of the current portfolio, as that one was made in high school.
