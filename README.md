# Personal Website - Updated Version
Current Domain: Calvinjmin.com 

As a current First-Year at the University of Virginia, this project will be used to display my personal portfolio as an aspiring software engineer. This entire website was made from scratch using a custom domain purchases through Route 53 (AWS). This personal website will be an updated version of the current portfolio, as that one was made in high school.
